Exploring Nature's Defenders: Genome-wide identification and characterization of Major Latex Protein and Glycine Rich Protein families in Chelidonium majus

## Overview

This repository contains bioinformatics scripts and workflows for comprehensive genomic analyses of *Chelidonium majus* (Greater Celandine), focusing on the identification, characterization, and evolutionary analysis of Major Latex Protein (MLP) and Glycine Rich Protein (GRP) gene families. These protein families play crucial roles in plant defense mechanisms and stress responses.

### About Chelidonium majus

*Chelidonium majus* (Greater Celandine) is a herbaceous perennial plant known for its yellow-orange latex and medicinal properties. As a member of the Papaveraceae family, it produces a rich array of secondary metabolites and defense-related proteins that protect the plant from herbivores and pathogens.

### Protein Families of Interest

**Major Latex Proteins (MLPs)**: A family of defense-related proteins originally identified in the latex of opium poppy. MLPs belong to the Bet v 1 superfamily and are involved in various stress responses, including pathogen defense and abiotic stress tolerance. They are characterized by their conserved structural domains and diverse expression patterns across different plant tissues.

**Glycine Rich Proteins (GRPs)**: A diverse group of structural and regulatory proteins characterized by repetitive glycine-rich motifs. GRPs participate in cell wall structure, signal transduction, and defense responses. Their flexibility and ability to interact with various cellular components make them key players in plant development and stress adaptation.

### Research Scope

This project employs computational genomics approaches to:
- Identify and annotate MLP and GRP gene family members in the *C. majus* genome
- Analyze gene structures, conserved domains, and motif compositions
- Investigate phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary patterns
- Examine expression profiles and functional diversification
- Predict subcellular localization and potential functional roles

Similar genomic studies have been conducted for other plant species, providing insights into the evolution and functional diversification of these important defense protein families across the plant kingdom.
